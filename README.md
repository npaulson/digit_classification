## Synopsis

This project demonstrates the use of various machine learning algorithms to identify handwritten digits.

## Motivation

It is interesting to see the varying efficacy of different algorithms, and the effects of changing the parameters which control thier functionality

## References

The handwritten digit dataset in this code was taken from Andrew Ng's coursera course. Dr. Ng obtained this data from MNIST database, http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
